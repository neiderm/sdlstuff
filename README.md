Trying to remember how to do 3D rendering in software and starting looking
 at the classic book "Black Art of 3D Game Programming".

Reading this book (about 20 years ago!) was my first foray into C language!
Example code from BAo3DGP is all DOS based, with hard-coded reference to
VGA Mode 13 framebuffer at fixed resolution, so it's not of much practical 
use as it is. However, it seems that the algorithms might be useful if they can 
be adapted to a modern computer system. At the same time I have been learning SDL
from excellent Lazy Foo tutorials:
 @ http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL
The resulting code in this repository uses examples from Lazy Foo to adapt 
the BAo3DGP algorithms to SDL2. Dev OS is Linux/Xubuntu, build environment
is GCC using Code::Blocks. Enjoy! -GN
